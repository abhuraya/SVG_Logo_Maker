## Installation
all you have to do is fork this git and then clone it into your own files, then open the folder and input node index.js into your terminal 

## Usage
the end user could use this to create simple and easy logos extremely quickly. 

## Challenges
this project posed many challenges during coding. mainly the lack of available information on ||||||||||||||||. Alternatively another problem was finding an abundant information on svg generation and using it to code my half of the project before realizing that the type of generation i was doing did not apply at all to the project at hand. 
another issue i had was figuring out how to set up every function without repeating myself and breaking the DRY rule
